What I need to implement:
	insertionSort()
	partition()	
	quicksortWithCutOff() Both versions
	quicksort()
	twoWayMerge()
	threeWayMerge()
	twoWayMergeSort()
	threeWayMergeSort()
	
	
Start with the selection sort. 

Then move on to quicksort. Partition is used as a helper function for the quicksort methods. 

Do the merge methods last. They are the toughest. Give yourself time to write and test them.
